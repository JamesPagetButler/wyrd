# Integrating Wyrd with Contextus

Status: target for Contextus Walk-phase, aligned with **Contextus Spec v1.3**
([contextus#2](https://github.com/JamesPagetButler/contextus/pull/2), in §I4 review).
Contextus is the cross-domain pattern-matching layer; Wyrd is its
storage substrate for InsightSignals and the source side of the
Contextus → CTH bridge.

> **Synthesis as the persistence boundary** (Spec v1.3 §4.4 invariant): the
> session-scoped agents (Edge Scout, Corpus Edge Scout, Bridge Agent) emit
> ephemeral NATS-only findings on `ctx.edge.boundary.*` /
> `ctx.corpus.diversity` / `ctx.bridge.intervention.*`. **Only Synthesis
> agents** subscribed to those topics mint a persistent `NT_INSIGHT_SIGNAL`
> (`Type = "contextus.signal.synthesis"`) when an ephemeral finding warrants
> persistence. The session-scoped agents themselves never write Wyrd state.

## What Contextus gets from Wyrd

- A typed hypergraph for InsightSignals — the cross-domain pattern
  candidates produced from scout, correlation, and synthesis activity.
- Atomic promotion to CTH via `compute.Bridge.Promote`.
- Reusable consistency primitives for the multi-source claim agreement
  case (where Contextus has detected a candidate cross-domain match
  and needs to evaluate whether the agreeing chains are consistent
  before promoting).
- A formal soundness anchor for the "3+ domains agree" pattern via the
  higher-arity irreducibility theorem.

## Mapping Contextus types to Wyrd types

| Contextus concept | Wyrd type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| InsightSignal | `model.Node` of `Type = "contextus.signal"` | Carries a `SignalSource` sub-attribute (see below) |
| `SignalSource` enum | embedded in `Node.Payload` as JSON | Values: `scout` \| `correlation` \| `synthesis` |
| `EvidencePointer` | `model.Node` of `Type = "contextus.evidence-pointer"` | "Where, not what" — points to a corpus locator, never embeds the evidence itself |
| Physical scope (focus area) | `model.Node` of `Type = "contextus.scope.physical"` | Spec v1.3 §4.6 (e.g., a sensor footprint, a geographic region) |
| Conceptual scope (focus area) | `model.Node` of `Type = "contextus.scope.conceptual"` | Spec v1.3 §4.6 (e.g., a topic / theory / frame) |
| Scope membership (`HE_SCOPE_MEMBERSHIP`) | `model.Hyperedge` of arity 2 with `Type = "contextus.scope.member"` | Connects a scope to signals/observations within it; payload is `ScopeMembership` |
| Cross-domain match candidate | `model.Hyperedge` connecting InsightSignals from N domains | Arity ≥ 3 → Theorem 2 irreducibility applies |

### Session-scoped agents are NATS-only, not Wyrd state

The session-scoped Contextus agents — **Edge Scout / Corpus Edge Scout
/ Bridge Agent** — emit findings on NATS subjects (`ctx.edge.boundary.*`,
`ctx.corpus.diversity`, `ctx.bridge.intervention.*`) and **never persist
to Wyrd**. Their outputs are ephemeral by design (Spec v1.3 §4.5
"session state is not persisted").

**Synthesis** is the global agent that *subscribes* to those NATS topics
and decides — at the confidence threshold — whether a finding warrants
persistence. When it does, Synthesis mints a fresh
`NT_INSIGHT_SIGNAL` with `Type = "contextus.signal.synthesis"` and
authors it via Wyrd's `Graph.AddNode`. This is the sole persistence
boundary between Contextus's session activity and Wyrd's substrate;
no other agent writes Wyrd state.

Provenance (which agent class minted a given signal) lives on the
signal itself via `SignalSource` in `Node.Payload`, not as a separate
node. The mint-time confidence-threshold check happens in Synthesis,
upstream of Wyrd; Wyrd does not enforce hypothesis-tier admission.

InsightSignals typically live at `TierComplex` (scalar evidence) or
`TierQuaternion` (when the signal carries a phase or polarisation
attribute from a QBP-domain source).

> **`EvidencePointer` shape — Contextus Spec v1.3 is authoritative.**

> Spec v1.3 §11.1; the *actual* per-tier minimum (per Spec v1.3 §5.4.3)

## Soundness citations Contextus gains

- Bridge promotion to CTH: `Wyrd.Bridge.bridge_promote_preserves_count`
  guarantees no signal is lost in transit.
- N-way agreement: when Contextus flags a candidate match where
  N ≥ 3 InsightSignals from independent domains agree, the underlying
  hyperedge carries irreducible joint information per
  `Wyrd.HolographicHypergraphHigherArity.theorem2_irreducibility_n_arity`.
  This is the formal substrate for the "synergy" claim Spec v1.3 makes
  about 3+ domain confluences.
- Triangle consistency on three-domain agreements:
  `compute.TriangleAdditive` and `compute.TriangleMultiplicative`.

## Sketch

```go
import (
    "encoding/json"
    "github.com/JamesPagetButler/wyrd/model"
    "github.com/JamesPagetButler/wyrd/compute"
)

// SignalSource is the Contextus-side enum carried in Node.Payload.
type SignalSource string

const (
    SourceScout       SignalSource = "scout"
    SourceCorrelation SignalSource = "correlation"
    SourceSynthesis   SignalSource = "synthesis"
)

// EvidencePointer (illustrative — not the canonical type).
//
// Wyrd's view is the opaque Node.Payload bytes; the canonical struct
// lives in Contextus Spec v1.3 §11.1 and includes tier-conditional
// Hash / SizeBytes / LoadedAt / AccessHint / Note fields. The form
// below is sized for this sketch's three-line example only.
type EvidencePointer struct {
    Corpus    string  `json:"corpus"`     // illustrative — Spec v1.3 doesn't have this field
    Locator   string  `json:"locator"`    // canonical (Spec v1.3 §11.1)
    Confidence float64 `json:"confidence,omitempty"` // illustrative — Spec v1.3 puts confidence on InsightSignal, not pointer
}

// Add an InsightSignal as a node, with provenance and evidence pointers
// in the payload.
type signalPayload struct {
    Source    SignalSource     `json:"source"`
    Evidence  []EvidencePointer `json:"evidence"`
    DetectedBy string          `json:"detected_by,omitempty"` // human-readable agent label, optional
}

payload, _ := json.Marshal(signalPayload{
    Source:   SourceScout,
    Evidence: []EvidencePointer{{Corpus: "edna", Locator: "goa-2026-week-12"}},
})

sig := model.Node{
    ID:      model.NodeID("contextus:signal:" + signalID),
    Type:    model.NodeType("contextus.signal"),
    Tier:    model.TierComplex,
    Created: signal.DetectedAt,
    Payload: payload,
}
g.AddNode(sig)

// Add a 3-domain match as a hyperedge:
match := model.Hyperedge{
    ID:      model.HyperedgeID("contextus:match:" + matchID),
    Nodes:   []model.NodeID{sig1, sig2, sig3},
    Weight:  model.NewComplexWeight(score, 0),
    Created: time.Now(),
}
g.AddHyperedge(match)

// When the match is judged Bridge-eligible, promote into CTH:
br := &compute.Bridge{Source: contextusGraph, Destination: cthGraph}
if err := br.Promote(match.ID); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("contextus: bridge: %w", err)
}
```

## Open questions

Both prior open questions are now **answered**:

1. ~~Do agents author edges through one shared `model.Graph` or per-agent
   graphs?~~ **Answered (Spec v1.3):** agents are session-scoped and
   ephemeral; they don't author edges directly. InsightSignals authored
   by the agents are stored in a single shared `model.Graph` with
   `SignalSource` distinguishing provenance.
2. ~~Should hypothesis-tier "fish-on-the-line" candidates be persisted
   into Wyrd before the Bridge Agent's confidence threshold?~~
   **Answered (Spec v1.3 §4.4):** synthesis subscribes to
   `ctx.bridge.intervention`, `ctx.edge.boundary.*`, and
   `ctx.corpus.diversity` and mints InsightSignals only when ephemeral
   session findings warrant persistence. The "where not what"
   `EvidencePointer` discipline (Spec v1.3 §5.x) keeps the graph from
   inflating with low-quality embedded evidence.
